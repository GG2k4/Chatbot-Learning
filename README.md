# Chatbot-Learning

This repository contains my learning of how to make conversational AI.

## Model 1
This folder was the first I created. It has intents json file containing tag, patterns and answers to describe the vocabulary.
It also has two python files, One for training and one for predicting.

## Model 2
This contains files regarding my learnnig on the usage of Keras, TensorFlow, and Tokenizers. IT contains few models such as a file  to see if the statement is sarcastic, a file to do sentiment analysis, and a file to make poetry starting with a prompt based on irish folksongs.

## Model 3
I have created this folder to try different models of using LLMs. The first file I created was simply to use open source LLMs from huggingface transformers and use gradios library to make a user interface and render it. (Chtbt1.py)
The second file I made to start learning fine-tuning of LLMs with LORA to do sentiment analysis. (finetune.py)
The third file (I am still working on) is to use prompt engineering to autograde short answer type questions. I found quite lot of code was depriciated and saw a lot of documentations, however I still need to make this work.
